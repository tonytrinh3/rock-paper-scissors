# Front-end: Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge

![Design preview for the Rock, Paper, Scissors coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use a front-end JavaScript framework/library such as [React](https://reactjs.org). 

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser

### Rules
If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.
- Paper beats Rock
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper

### Bonus
- Use CSS Animation on selection of weapon.
- Don't use a CSS framework (No bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, etc.)
- Even though we allow libraries, try to rely as little as possible on third-party libraries. As our main focus is your own code.

#### Extra Time
Build Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You can either choose the `original` designs for the simpler version or the `extra_time` designs for the harder version. You will find both mobile and desktop versions of the design to work to. Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
